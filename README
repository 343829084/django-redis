This is a simple Redis cache backend for django.  It is fast, but compared to memcached, it performs a little more slowly.However, the cache is persistent so if that is what you need more than speed, this is the way to go.

Note:  Redis writes to disk asynchronously so there is a slight chance of losing some data, but for most purposes this is acceptable.

I included the python client library that comes with Redis:

Installation:

    1. Put redis.py and client.py somewhere on you python path

    2. In your django settings file put: CACHE_BACKEND = 'path.to.redis://<host>:<port>'
